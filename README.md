This repository contains Dockerfiles of ready to run Scipio ERP installs. 

There are two tags you can choose from:

empty: An empty instance of Scipio ERP (only minimal seed data loaded)
demo: An instance of Scipio ERP with some demo data to get you started quickly and give you a good overview of the Scipio ERP features

**Please note that we do not recommend those images for production use. They are based on the Derby embedded database and have not been hardened for optimal security.**
